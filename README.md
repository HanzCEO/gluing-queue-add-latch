# GlueX Glueing Queue â€“ Prioritizing Liquidity Module Integrations  

The **GlueX Glueing Queue** ranks liquidity modules based on their importance to the ecosystem, ensuring that **high-impact protocols** get integrated first. 

## How is Priority Determined?

Each liquidity module is ranked using the **Glueing Score** formula:   

```math
Glueing Score = (Trade Volume over past 7 days in $M) * (Number of Chains Deployed) * (Total Value Locked in $M)
```

Notes that,

- If any data is missing, the protocol is **placed at the bottom of the queue**.  
- Anyone (protocol teams, community members) can **challenge rankings** by submitting updated data **with verifiable sources**.

## Fast-Tracking a Moduleâ€™s Integration  

If your protocol wants **faster integration**, you can offer a **bounty** to incentivize GlueX's Gluers community to prioritize your module.  

### How to Expedite Your Integration  
1. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** following the [PR Submission Template](./PR-template.md).  
2. **Provide complete and verifiable data** for trade volume, TVL, and supported chains.  
3. **Assign a bounty** to attract faster implementation:  
   - Specify the amount of tokens and token to be rewarded.  
   - Bounties will be displayed publicly in the Glueing Queue.  
4. **Discuss your integration with the GlueX team** to optimize the process.  

To ensure the integrity of the glueing process, we require bounties to be locked on an escrow account as soon as a Gluer has officially started your integration.
